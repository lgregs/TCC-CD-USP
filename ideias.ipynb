Following Arslan & Karan (2009), a Debt-to-Equity ratio above 3 was considered indicative of elevated financial risk, while a Current Ratio exceeding 2 reflected robust liquidity. Profitability, measured by ROE and margins, received the highest weight (25%) in the composite health index, consistent with empirical findings on Turkish firm performance drivers (Ciftci et al., 2019). Liquidity and cash flow indicators received 20% each, aligning with their predictive role in bankruptcy studies (Beaver, 1966; Ohlson, 1980).‚Äù\n",
